🤖 Storm – Virtual Voice Assistant

Storm is a Python-based virtual voice assistant with a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.
It listens to voice commands, processes them using speech recognition, and responds using text-to-speech.

This project is ideal for Python mini projects, AI/NLP beginners, and academic submissions.
